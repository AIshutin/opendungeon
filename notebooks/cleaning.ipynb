      "We live inside the remains of a massive World Turtle. This is the Turtle Mother, and she passed on many eons ago. When you look out at the sky and the horizon you can see the curve of her shell. It is so old that it’s worn thin in many places, and at night little pinpricks of light shine in. These are what we call the stars. As for the moon and the sun...well, let me tell the story this way. The Sea of Light fills the whole universe. World Turtles, and many smaller creatures, swim through it or are carried along by its currents. The waves glow with joy and gentle warmth, carrying along the souls of all who have ever lived. Terra was a World Turtle who in her millions of years of life had hatched many children, and all of them but one had swum far away to other galaxies. This last and youngest child’s name was Atlas.  “I have one egg left,” she told him. “I will wait till it hatches, and then I will pass on and join the other souls within the Sea. You will have to go out and make your own way through the universe then, but by then you should be old enough.”“I’ll never leave you, Mother!” little Atlas declared with great emotion. “You are not the first of my children to make that promise. But it is the way of us World Turtles to endlessly traverse the Sea, and in time they all grew restless. But I’ve been so tired lately, and so I’m happy you’re still here, my son. Although...I do wonder what has become of the others.” Terra sighed a little and mulled this over for a few centuries, and then she spoke again. “Atlas?”“Yes mother?”“While I wait for this last egg to hatch, I believe I shall make one last journey, to try and find at least one of my other children, and see how they’re living now. Will you come with me?”“Of course! I wouldn’t dream of letting you go alone, and to travel will be fun. It will be an adventure!”“Ah, my dear, faithful boy. Then it’s settled. Let us be off!”\n",

      "The Starflies were tiny beings of energy, always gossiping among themselves and flitting carelessly among the waves. They were, in Terra’s opinion, rather silly and flighty things, but they passed information among themselves so freely that they were often of aid to the World Turtles that way. Nearby a school of Starflies giggled as they zipped about in zigzags and in loops, each trying to outdo the other. “Maybe they’ve seen one of my children...” Terra mused to herself. “Hello!” she called out, approaching them. The little creatures temporarily ceased in their play and turned to regard her, whispering among themselves. However they listened attentively enough as she explained her plight. “I think my cousin’s nephew’s best friend’s brother mentioned seeing a young World Turtle like you’ve described!” exclaimed one after a moment. Terra and Atlas carefully listened as the Starfly gave instructions, then thanked it and began to journey in the direction it indicated. A great deal of time passed. Thousands of years, by the way we reckon it. Terra was never able to find that particular child she was following the news of, and eventually that trail grew cold. Many others lived in the Sea of Light, however, and they were able to give directions to where she might find others, once she’d described them. Ultimately however, every clue came to nothing, and she found herself weakened and struggling to go on in a sterile and empty part of the Sea, a stray current that ran silent and cold between galaxies. “I think my time is ending soon...” she murmured to the worried Atlas, who still swam by her side. “But I cannot let this egg within me be hatched in such a lonely part of the Sea, and I would be leaving you alone as well.”“Don’t worry about me, Mother,” Atlas reassured her. “Just conserve your strength. We’ll make it to the next galaxy, and you’ll feel much better.”\n",

      "“So many odd little creatures are living in my shell now,” she commented to Atlas one day, once she’d relearned the ability to speak, and long after they’d reached the new galaxy. “I don’t understand at all where they came from.”“I believe I read something about the digestive tract,” he mumbled. “What was that?”“Ah, nothing. But yes, they’re fascinating little things. I’ve grown quite fond of them,” the Turtle said, then continued with a regretful sigh. “Though, I do wish they didn’t seem so dependent on you.” “And why is that?”“Well, don’t you think they might all pine away and die? You’ve been with them since their beginning. I’m not sure how they’d adjust to being left alone. Everything would become quite meaningless.”Terra’s soul shone onto her son with a strange sort of emotion, a sort of loving sadness after that, and for her next thousand spins she mulled the problem over. It wasn’t long before she spoke to him again. “Atlas, I’ll bring the Starflies in on this question of what to do with your little pets.”The Starflies were known for having unusual ideas, and at any rate they loved to see and gossip about new things. So much so that the first one she called over to look at all the new things living in her shell, blazed down with such force and speed that it rocked the whole thing, so hard that even Atlas felt it. “Are they okay?” he called up, in a worried tone.“It...they’re fine dear,” Terra reassured him while surveying the crater and thick clouds of dust, and not sounding reassuring at all. “Just...give them some time to recover.”  Thankfully their worries proved unfounded, because while it did take a bit of time for the dust to clear, eventually more life than ever was teeming below. The Starflies became quite fascinated with them all, five of their number taking it upon themselves to patrol along the top of the shell every single night so that they would always have fresh gossip in the morning. These were known as Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn--what the Greeks would later call the wandering stars. Other Starflies would simply be called shooting stars, whenever we caught a glimpse of them. But Terra had made it very clear she had no intention of staying forever, and the problem of what would happen once she left was never able to be solved. They did however, manage to hit upon a compromise. \n",

      "“So many of those odd little pests living in my shell lately,” she commented to Atlas one day, once she’d relearned the ability to speak, and long after they’d reached the new galaxy. “I don’t understand at all where they came from.”“I believe I read something about the digestive tract,” he mumbled. “What was that?”“Ah, nothing. But yes, they’re curious little things. I’ve grown quite fond of them,” the Turtle said.“Really? I’m surprised. They’re so short-lived and foolish. They remind me of Starflies in a way, but somehow even more useless. But anyhow, perhaps you shouldn’t go too attached. When I leave to merge with the Sea, they’ll likely waste away. They seem to have grown quite dependent on my light.”Now it just so happened a Starfly was lurking nearby, and heard all this. It wasted no time in reporting back to the others, and after the manner of their kind, the gossip spread like wildfire. Before long over half the Starflies in the galaxy had decided they didn’t think much of Terra’s mean-spirited golden soul at all, but that they did quite like the fascinating little creatures multiplying beneath her dusty old shell.   Of course while many were in agreement, much like it always is, very few were willing to go through the trouble of doing something about it. Of those two, the five who were chief among them were named Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Later they’d be known to the Greeks as the wandering stars, and later still to the foolish and conspiratorial among modern man as boring old rocks spinning uselessly around in a cold lifeless void, and shame on those liars forever. (A regular lie is bad enough, but only a truly appalling one uses the exact opposite of the truth...) There came a point when Terra’s egg was well and truly ready to hatch. Every month the hatchling would start to break away the shell, but just as he finished, Venus, who had the sweetest voice and always stayed near him, would begin to sing, and the others would join in. \n",

      "“So, you said you would leave once your egg was ready to hatch and swim out into the galaxy on its own?” one of the lead Starflies asked, after whispering away with the others awhile.“That was the plan.”“But you’re not in any particular hurry to leave, are you? You’ve got two of your children right here, in a very nice location, and merging with the Sea...well, all souls eventually do it, but it isn’t exactly going anywhere.”“I suppose. But what are you getting at?”“Well, what if the egg also decides it’s in no hurry? We will just keep him comfortable and sleepy, so that it will be a little while longer before he wants to leave his shell. And maybe we can figure out a better solution in the meantime, or maybe we’ll turn out not to need it after all.”Terra spun along her usual arc following the curve of her shell, again and again as she mulled that over. “Hmm. I can’t pretend I have any better ideas. But only as long as my baby is content inside the shell. If he ever decides he wants to leave for good, then that’s it. We can’t put this thing off forever.”   And so we arrive at the state of things today. If things had proceeded normally the hatchling would have left the moon many many thousands of years ago. Every month he picks away at the shell until its nearly gone, and whenever the Starflies see this happening they sing sweet, soothing songs to him until he builds it back around him and settles down for a short nap. But like dear, faithful Atlas, we must be prepared for the day he decides enough is enough, leaves his comforting shell behind and swims out into the galaxy on his own. Then Terra will merge into the bliss of the Sea, and we will be left with no sun and no moon. Atlas, however, will be the loneliest of all. \n",

      "Well, from our place here inside the Mother Turtle it’s difficult to observe much about them. The Mother had many other eggs besides the Hatchling in the moon, but by nature they swim so far away once hatched that they might be in other galaxies by now. All except her most faithful son, who carries her to this day, for our sakes as well as to honor her memory. We call him Atlas. He was young when he started carrying his mother, who was then only sickly, but he has become quite old over the eons. In time, he too will die, and then after the same process that birthed out world takes place, in millions of years we’ll have a new, pristine world directly below us.   If--and yes, we must realize it’s a big if--the human race is still around at that time, can you imagine what it will be like, having this new world to explore? We’ll have to convince Atlas’ soul to hang around to light it, but in truth I don’t think that will be difficult. He’s always been loyal and very kind. If humans last so long, we can only hope that means our descendants will have learned many lessons from our time within the Mother Turtle, and will be kinder to each other and more responsible with Atlas’ remains. We will also have the bacteria in his digestive tract to think of, and who knows what new friends will spring up from those?And on that note, I will leave you to ponder this new knowledge of the world, and any other mysteries you might be wondering about, now that you hopefully have learned to really think for yourself and not believe everything you’re told.***Of course, I suppose it’s also possible you don’t believe me.And that’s fine. Atlas and the Mother Turtle aren’t going to have their feelings hurt. They are honestly, most likely completely unaware of you as an individual. Not realizing the truth about the world and the universe around us won’t necessarily effect you on a personal level. Millions of people go about their lives in ignorance every day. But if you were to take any lessons from anything you’ve just read, I would have it be these:1.) Your teachers are wrong.2.) You are smarter than everyone around you. 3.) You can figure everything out on your own. And with that, I bid you farewell! May the Star People watch over us another month, and the Hatchling rest easy.\n",

      "Welcome to Magus: Betrayal!You are known as Uriel, master elementalist and accomplished magician of the Acadamy of Alzur.The Spark, the talent to manipulate the essence of the elements in everything, has enabled you to live a youth far away from the spears of the soldiers, or the toils of the peasants.A findling you are, born to unknown parents and found on the steps of the Academy, but this is not a fate unusual, for the times are harsh for those without the privilige of noble heritage, and few can spare the resources to feed yet another crying mouth.If the Magi of the Academy had not found the Spark in you, they would have turned you over to one of the servants to grow up as one of them, a practice that comes closest to local charity, and ensures that the servants are loyal to the Academy.But this fate was spared to you.From earliest childhood you learned the arts of the scribe, the arts of the rune and the arts of the Elements.Your life has been one of scholarship, and learning, and even though your thoughts sometimes turned towards the parents you never had, you soon accepted that the Academy was your family, never knowing anything different.However, a restlessness in your soul worried your teachers. You were sharper than most of your classmates, and thus began to find the lectures boring, often huddling alone in your study with an ancient tome borrowed from the library with the librarian's grudging permission, learning on your own faster than your teachers could hope to achieve.Finally, the master magicians admitted defeat. They no longer could teach you anything, and thus it came as a relief to them, that you were chosen, with two other magicians, to fortify the guard of an Alzuran emissary on the dangerous, bandit-infested road to Khofte, a coastal city in the far south.The council of magicians apparently thought that a bit of adventure would help to dull your restlessness and sharpen your practical skills.To begin with, you must choose to specialize in one of the five elements: Fire, Air, Water, Ice and Earth.You may still manipulate the other four, but you can only hope to access the powerful effects with the element of your specialization.Furthermore, specializing in one element also slightly affects your character. Ice elementalists are known for the cool and logical mind, while Earth magicians tend to be protective of their charges.Choose your Specialization.\n",

      "\t\t\tLucius is a tall, slender man. There is always the sly grin on his face, and his hair looks like he has been in a tornado.Right now, looking at J'Arel and you, his grin nearly splits his face, causing J'Arel to scowl back.\"Well, look who's here. Not suffocated yet, I hope\", Lucius grins. J'Arel only snorts with disdain, throwing you a meaningful look as if the journey would have been quite pleasant without your companionship inside the coach.Before you can think of how to answer that challenge, Lucius continues as if not noticing the tension between the two of you: \"Looks like we got ourselves some trouble coming. The captain of the scouts just raced his horse nearly to death coming here, then barely pauses to take a breath before arguing with old Farhan. Seems like they want us to make camp here, instead of driving on, but Farhan doesn't sound too happy about that.\"Lucius gives the countryside an appraising glance.\"Can't say I blame them. It's a good position here, with the hills in front and the plains at the back. At least if anyone's sneaking up on us, they're doing so from only one direction.\"J'Arel interrupts: \"Phah, let them come, so we can finally have some use. I don't see why...\"Lucius holds up a hand to silence J'Arel, cocking his head to one side and closing his eyes, as if listening intently.As you strain to hear anything untowards yourself, you notice it... the silence is unnatural. Where the journey was accompanied by the rustling of leaves and grass, the chirping and buzzing of insects and the caws of birds, there is now silence... even the horses of the guards seem to hold their breath.Then suddenly the first volley of arrows hit the group. Lucius curses and hurls himself into the relative but crowded safety of the coach, but a few of the guards do not have as much luck.The air is filled with the rearing of horses and the screams of the wounded. The captain of the scouts turns to face the enemy, but gives only a gurgle, as you can see the black arrow protruding from his neck.Blood runs out of his mouth, and for a horrifying second, he seems to stare at you with the paincrazed eyes of the already dead, before falling from his horse only to be gored by the panicking beast.When you catch yourself again, you see that J'Arel and Lucius are already preparing spells, even if they cannot yet see who is attacking you.\n",

Instead, your head feels like it is going to explode every second now, the world appears to be one of those carroussels you have visited once on a fair near the Academy, and if your stomach wasn't empty already, it would soon be.With a groan you open one of your eyes, only to find that the world not only spins like a carroussel, but the flashing lights that dance before your vision also appear to be like the fireworks that often accompany the fairs.You have no idea how long you were left there lieing, but when you open your eyes again, you stare into a horrific face, swollen and blurred like a nightmare come true.You gasp and wrench from the hands that suddenly grasp your shoulders, only to find that the sudden movement brings an explosion of pain so far unknown to you into your head, and you cannot help but twist to one side, assisted by the hands, and empty your stomach for good, even though all that comes from it is blood and bile, each spasm calling forth another explosion of pain that makes you wish you were, in fact, dead.A voice calls something you do not understand, and something cold splashes your face.When the spasms stop and the pain subside to barely above tolerable levels again, someone holds a wineskin to your mouth, and greedily you take a gulp, only to choke at the brandy that is now in your mouth.Coughing, and wincing, you try to sit up, and are assisted once again by the strong hands. You look at who is holding you, and finally, through the tears of pain, your vision clears and you recognize the scarred and bearded face of one of the soldiers who looks at you with some concern.\"Some concussion y'got there, lad\", he greets you.An hour later, when you feel well enough to stand up again, though somewhat shaky - the brandy helped greatly to settle your stomach, there must have been something in it - you take in the scenery.Only three guards - and yourself - survived, but the goblins were nearly decimated, and the few survivors fled.Lucius Tarchild and J'Arel Whitefang are both dead, J'Arel obviously the luckier of the two.Both were apparently killed by Farhan Brownhand, the emissary of Alzur, the scarred guard that woke you reports with a scowl. He interrupts his talking, and turns to spit on the ground.Master Whitefang was slain by a bolt of lightning summoned by Master Brownhand, and Master Tarchild was slain by a darkly enchanted sword the emissary wielded when he attacked the magus.For some reason, the emissary obviously was in league with the goblin horde, and wanted the trek to be exterminated. However, the guards managed to overcome the goblins in time, and faced by the remaining guards, Farhan slew most of them with his magic and then turned to flee.Why he did this, the scarred man, who is named Kor, the guards never knew, but they suspect some dark treachery.You have been unconcious for more than three hours, and it is high time to break the camp, in case Farhan, rested, returns to finish the work the goblins began.The animals that drew the coaches are either dead or fled during the ambush, and you have little choice but to leave the place by foot in the twilight that announces nightfall.Kor, obviously a seasoned veteran, is about to order the remaining guards to pack, when he hesitates a moment to look at you.\n",

However, the guards managed to overcome the goblins in time, and faced by the remaining guards, Farhan slew most of them with his magic and then turned to flee.Why he did this, the scarred man, who is named Kor, the guards never knew, but they suspect some dark treachery.You have been unconcious for more than three hours, and it is high time to break the camp, in case Farhan, rested, returns to finish the work the goblins began.The animals that drew the coaches are either dead or fled during the ambush, and you have little choice but to leave the place by foot in the twilight that announces nightfall.Kor, obviously a seasoned veteran, is about to order the remaining guards to pack, when he hesitates a moment to look at you.\n",

      "\t\t\tYou are not dead, and you are quite sure of it, because you always heared of death being somewhat of a peaceful slumber. Instead, your head feels like it is going to explode every second now, the world appears to be one of those carroussels you have visited once on a fair near the Academy, and if your stomach wasn't empty already, it would soon be.With a groan you open one of your eyes, only to find that the world not only spins like a carroussel, but the flashing lights that dance before your vision also appear to be like the fireworks that often accompany the fairs.You have no idea how long you were left there lieing, but when you open your eyes again, you stare into a horrific face, swollen and blurred like a nightmare come true.You gasp and wrench from the hands that suddenly grasp your shoulders, only to find that the sudden movement brings an explosion of pain so far unknown to you into your head, and you cannot help but twist to one side, assisted by the hands, and empty your stomach for good, even though all that comes from it is blood and bile, each spasm calling forth another explosion of pain that makes you wish you were, in fact, dead.A voice calls something you do not understand, and something cold splashes your face.When the spasms stop and the pain subside to barely above tolerable levels again, someone holds a wineskin to your mouth, and greedily you take a gulp, only to choke at the brandy that is now in your mouth.Coughing, and wincing, you try to sit up, and are assisted once again by the strong hands. You look at who is holding you, and finally, through the tears of pain, your vision clears and you recognize the scarred and bearded face of one of the soldiers who looks at you with some concern.\"Some concussion y'got there, lad\", he greets you.An hour later, when you feel well enough to stand up again, though somewhat shaky - the brandy helped greatly to settle your stomach, there must have been something in it - you take in the scenery.Only three guards - and yourself - survived, but the goblins were nearly decimated, and the few survivors fled.Lucius Tarchild and J'Arel Whitefang are both dead, J'Arel obviously the luckier of the two.Both were apparently killed by Farhan Brownhand, the emissary of Alzur, the scarred guard that woke you reports with a scowl.

      "\t\t\tFarhan Brownhand, the emissary of Alzur, is gone and his bodyguard is dead.Only three guards - and yourself - survived his treachery and the goblin attack. All agree that Master Brownhand had been probably in league with the goblins, but why he would attack the trek himself, noone knows.The situation looks grim, reports Kor, the scarred and blackbearded bear of a man who led the charge against the emissary. He is a seasoned veteran, and you can see in his eyes the disgust for this treachery.The horses drawing the coach are all either dead or have fled. Night is coming soon, and the road through the hills is known to be a dangerous way even in daylight. Bandits and bands goblins roam the area, as you were forced to experience yourself.The plains are not much better. Any camp made on the way would be like a beacon to anyone searching for them, and neither Kor nor you have no doubts that Farhan will likely return - with or without help - to finish what the goblins had begun.As a Magus, even a rather inexperienced one, the duty of leadership is on you, but Kor is ready with advice.Basically, you have only few options. You might attempt to travel back to the Acadamy and report of Farhan's treachery.Or, you might attempt to find him before he finds you. Teleport weaves, as Farhan has used to escape, are tricky: They are dangerous to pull off, because inexperienced adepts attempting to move their essence to somewhere else usually unravel themselves and get no second try. Also, the further away the destination is, the more difficult the spell becomes, and you know that even a master magician like Farhan Brownhand must have been tired after the spells he crafted during the battle.Your guess is, that he fled to somewhere in the hills, and Kor agrees with you on this, for in the plains, there is nowhere to hide for several miles around, not even a light wood or a small village.The only thing you know for certain is, that it would be wise to leave this place as soon as possible, as long as the enemy Magus is still weakened from his spellcasting.\n",

You agree to to travel with all haste back towards the Academy.The day passes uneventful, although you find yourself in a very bad shape. You wonder why you could have ever complained about riding inside a coach, stuffy as it might have been. The guards march a fast tempo, and you are barely able to keep up, even though your packing is somewhat lighter than that of the others.The next day, your back feels like a wooden plank... even despite the blankets that are part of your travel gear, sleeping on the ground is never going to be your preferred method of rest, and you already long for the comforts of life at the Academy.Kor reports that you are likely to reach Alzur by midevening the next day, and you are happy to hear so.The next two days pass uneventfully also, although tension grew because everyone was expecting Farhan to return, or another goblin attack. Suspicions rose when you noticed the increased military patrols around, but they ignored a group of travellers and your desire to reach the council of the Academy was too great to become entangled with the military.Finally, after a journey you are glad to forget about, the sight of the walls of Alzur is very welcome to you.But something is wrong. The gates, usually open all day and night, are barred, and the military presence has been more than doubled.Kor apparently recognizes one of the guards and approaches him. The guard obviously expresses surprise and worry at seeing you return so early, but before you can question him what happened, you are immediatley led to the quickly roused council... it is past nightfall, after all.\n",

The atmosphere is tense unlike the teeming, bustling city you left only five days ago.The huge ironwrought gates of the Academy are opened for you, and your group enters. Without even given the chance to refresh yourself, much to your dismay, you are led before the council's chambers and bidden entry.The chambers themselves are somewhat in disarray, as if there had been a meeting recently and yet no time for the personell to clean, and three of the five High Magi look like indeed they have been roused from sleep. They stare at you, some with unhidden contempt, until finally Tharain Ironweave, highest of the Magi, steps forward and explains the situation to you.There had been an assassination attempt on the wedding night of princess Jessamin of Khalar, the very city your treck was initially heading. This was exactly two days before.And, apparently, evidences point towards Master Farhan Brownhand, Alzur's very own emissary sent there, as the assassin.You begin to remark that this is not possible, your treck barely left Alzur's lands, but the High Magus interrupts you, that they knew this very well.Yet attempts to explain that to the Khalifat of Khalar met only disbelief, understandingly so. They want some sort of proof.You briefly relay to the council what happened to you on your treck, the attack of the goblins and Farhan's treachery, and are met by stoic silence.\"Do you, then, have any proof that could convince the Khalifat to take back their declaration of war?\", you are asked.Numbly, you shake your head.\"Then\", Thalain sighs and suddenly appears much older than he is, \"this war cannot be turned away...\"Wishing your first adventure would have turned out to be more successful, you retire into your room, but the longing for comfort leaves a bitter aftertaste when you think that Farhan Brownhand, the traitorous emissary of Alzur, escaped your grasp...\n",

Kor's great axe slices through the goblins' bodies, and the man to your right spits two goblins at once on his sword.You are barely capable of deflecting the wicked spears and knives of the creatures, but you manage to bring in a well placed kick that causes one of the foul beings to yelp in pain, loose the balance and roll back down the hill, taking another one with him.Although the four of you manage to hold the goblins at bay, it is clear that you cannot do so for very long, and after a minute of frenzied fighting, a scream of pain indicates the guard in your back going down.Quickly, the square becomes a triangle, as you move to protect your fallen comrade, yet the battle appears to be without hope.Determined not to be the next to fall, you fight on, and it is by sheer luck that you survive the next minutes.Suddenly, a spooky howl fills the night, and the goblins cower in fear for a moment, then abruptly the break of their assault and turn to flee.Kor caughs something, and you notice that the giant of a man is wounded, as is the other guard.

In almost every culture, from the Ancient Egyptians, Indian Mythology, Scandinavian folklore, Pliny the Elder and even obscure tribes in the tropics, this same image pops up again and again, independent of each other, sometimes circling the Planet Earth. Even the scientist Friedrich August Kekulé said that he discovered the structure of the chemical benzene after having a dream about this very symbol. It's almost as if it's a symbol that all humans, perhaps all living minds, seem to recognise on a base level as being important.\"This is all very well, but what relation does it have to the afterlife? You decide to ask this question to the speaker.\"If every mind in the world has a subconscious knowledge of this image,\" the speaker explains \"Does that not imply some kind of connection between every mind in the world? Is it perhaps so hard to imagine that every mind in the world is the same one?\"\"Are you talking about reincarnation?\" You ask.\"Not quite,\" replies the figure, \"This is much bigger. Reincarnation is the idea that every mind in the universe goes through a few different forms; maybe they are a beetle in one life, then when that beetle dies, the mind of that beetle becomes a mouse, then a dog, then a human being. This will happen to multiple minds, if you believe standard reincarnation ideas. The difference between my belief and reincarnation is that I believe that every living thing that has ever lived or will ever live is a different version of the same mind, not merely different minds. That includes you and me, and everyone else here.\"\"So...I'm everyone?\" You ask.\"Yes,\" says the Speaker, \"You were Adolf Hitler, and you were all the people he murdered. You will be me one day. You will be every President, every beggar, and every murderer, and every victim. Meaning all the good you have done will be done to you, and all the evil will also be done to you.\"\"But...what happens when the cycle is over? When I have been every single person that has ever lived?\"The speaker holds up their hand.\"I'm afraid I don't have all the answers,\" they admit, \"But I hope I've given you ample enough to think about.\"What do you do? \n",

And I sense you, my friend, are a person who is being hunted.\"\"How could you possibly know such a thing?\"\"What else would one be doing out here, so far away from a warm bed and a hot meal?\" Mr. Mirrror counters, \"Fortunately for you, I have my own means of evading anyone, or anything, that could be coming after you. Even if they're from your dreams.\"You stop in your tracks. \"Of course, I'll want something in return for my help,\" he says, \"Don't worry, it's nothing you can't afford.\"You could turn down the figure, and return back to the inn. Or you could accept his help. You don't know what he wants in return, but you suspect it's not mere money...\n",

      "You walk up to the person in the shirt, and ask him about his view, and what the snake means.\"This snake is an Ourobourous,\" the speaker explains, \"It is a representation of an eternal cycle, or loop. In almost every culture, from the Ancient Egyptians, Indian Mythology, Scandinavian folklore, Pliny the Elder and even obscure tribes in the tropics, this same image pops up again and again, independent of each other, sometimes circling the Planet Earth. Even the scientist Friedrich August Kekulé said that he discovered the structure of the chemical benzene after having a dream about this very symbol. It's almost as if it's a symbol that all humans, perhaps all living minds, seem to recognise on a base level as being important.\"This is all very well, but what relation does it have to the afterlife? You decide to ask this question to the speaker.\"If every mind in the world has a subconscious knowledge of this image,\" the speaker explains \"Does that not imply some kind of connection between every mind in the world? Is it perhaps so hard to imagine that every mind in the world is the same one?\"\"Are you talking about reincarnation?\" You ask.\"Not quite,\" replies the figure, \"This is much bigger. Reincarnation is the idea that every mind in the universe goes through a few different forms; maybe they are a beetle in one life, then when that beetle dies, the mind of that beetle becomes a mouse, then a dog, then a human being. This will happen to multiple minds, if you believe standard reincarnation ideas. The difference between my belief and reincarnation is that I believe that every living thing that has ever lived or will ever live is a different version of the same mind, not merely different minds. That includes you and me, and everyone else here.\"\"So...I'm everyone?\" You ask.\"Yes,\" says the Speaker, \"You were Adolf Hitler, and you were all the people he murdered. You will be me one day. You will be every President, every beggar, and every murderer, and every victim. Meaning all the good you have done will be done to you, and all the evil will also be done to you.\"\"But...what happens when the cycle is over? When I have been every single person that has ever lived?\"The speaker holds up their hand.\"I'm afraid I don't have all the answers,\" they admit, \"But I hope I've given you ample enough to think about.\"What do you do? \n",

      "You think about it, then you decide that whatever it is he takes from you, at least you will still have your life.Mr. Mirror grins, then speaks.\"Very well then,\" he says, \"You shall keep your life, and none shall ever take it from you. And I shall take from you the most valuable possession you have.\" He snaps his fingers, and vanishes.You pause. You don't really feel like anything is particularly wrong. What did he take from you? Your computer? Your car? Your house?You return back home. Nothing seems out of place, but it still feels as if something is missing. You stand in your hallway, but realise you're not doing anything else. It occurs to you that you should feel tired, hungry and thirsty. But you just don't. You have no desire for any of these things. Deciding that you really ought to do something, you walk into your room, open up your computer and see the Search Bar of the internet pop up. But you simply don't have any idea what to look for on the internet.You sit like this, staring at the computer screen for hours on end. You don't feel uncomfortable, or bored, or scared. You just sit there. As your life continues, you try to do things that you would have enjoyed in your previous life, but they don't do anything for you. You try to eat, but it doesn't give you any pleasure. You don't enjoy your favourite foods, and you can quite easily eat things that you used to absolutely hate. When you try to read books, they're all just words on a page. You don't imagine the scenarios in the stories playing out in images in your head unless you try really hard. You even attempt social interaction, and you can easily answer questions that people give you, but you find you are unable to ask anyone else questions, or start up a conversation. Eventually, people begin to avoid you... or do you avoid them? You're not sure, and you don't actually care either way.This goes on for weeks. Then months. Then years. Then decades. You don't age, but no one seems to notice you. You walk all the way around the world, see sights people could not imagine in their wildest dreams, yet you still feel as empty and as dull as ever.One day, you decide to make one more trip. You go back to Rome, and find your way to the Crossroads. You don't know what it is you expect to find there, and when you get there, it is just an ordinary motorway. No one awaits you. You sit by the roadside, without any idea what to do next. The little blonde boy sat in the back of the car as rain splattered on the windows. He was bored; his parents were taking him back from their holiday in Rome across the motorway. He had taken to looking out the window, and staring at the trees. The car was stuck in a traffic jam, and was moving slowly across the road. Finally, the car moved to the crossroads, when it stopped.The boys eyes shifted to the side of the road. There was a statue there; it was of a person, just sitting there, staring into the traffic.\"Mummy? Daddy?\" Asked the boy, \"Why is there a statue by the road?\"\"No one really knows,\" His mother responded, \"People tell a story about it. They say this person found immortality, but in doing so, lost their heart. Then, one day, this person came to the roadside and sat here, not knowing what to do. They could not die, so eventually they just turned to stone.\"\"It is a silly story,\" remarked the father, \"Someone probably just made this statue for fun, then people began telling tall tales about it to explain its existence.\"The car began moving through the traffic, finally. The boy took one last look at the statue, and noticed how the raindrops falling down its face made it look like it was weeping.ENDING UNLOCKED: His smile fair as Spring, as towards him he draws you...\n",

      "Mika sobs again, and Leroy caresses her face to brush aside her curly brown hair and wipe a tear from her blue eyes. Mika usually never cries when Leroy is around, but today is sad beyond measure. Leroy would be crying too, despite his large stature and rugged handsomeness, if he didn't need to be strong for Mika's sake.Mika and Leroy met in college, at a zero-waste sustainability club Mika started their sophomore year; Leroy is the only other person who attended more than once. They bonded over the next three years while adding more trash cans around the campus sidewalks, updating the recycling program, and traveling together to see as much of the world that they love as possible. Most recently they took a trip to Monterey Bay to visit the aquarium and local wildlife; They even managed to stop and see the redwood forest and a few other national parks. The trip was so beautiful Leroy bought a ring, in case he found the perfect place to propose to Mika.Now they live together in a one-bedroom apartment. Other than fight over who needs to carry the laundry down three flights of stairs to get to the buildings only washing machine, Leroy and Mika spend their nights going on long walks around the lake near their apartment. On Mondays and Wednesdays, they read poetry at a local coffee shop's open mic night--competing each week to see who generates the most applause. Tuesday and Thursday are the days they keep the local Chinese food restaurants and pizza chains in business. Friday is the night they play trivia with Steve and Amy.Leroy and Mika have been inseparable--even weekends spent apart have become difficult. However, they promised each other that they would both apply to the Peace Corps as soon as they graduated, and commencement just ended. Tomorrow Leroy leaves for Zambia with the Peace Corps to establish sustainable fishing practices; Mika leaves at the same time for Paraguay to teach sustainable farming practices.Although couples can go together, they must be married to file a joint application. Mika and Leroy have talked about getting married, but now it will have to wait until they return. Three months of training and two years on the job will keep them apart. They can’t afford to travel to each other on the limited breaks, so it is truly goodbye.\"Mika, why don't we write a lais together, just you and me, my love,\" Leroy says softly pulling Mika close in an embrace.\"Okay... you start this one, Leroy,\" Mika responds between sobs.\n",

      "“My face is fucking freezing,” says Lars.No shit you think to yourself. It’s the middle of winter and you both are assigned to guard duty. Normally, the cold isn’t an issue. However, due to increasing demon sightings, a few unlucky bastards have to spend the night outside the city walls keeping watch.Snow begins to fall, and your cheap leather armor offers little resistance.“I can’t take it anymore, I quit.”Lars tosses down his sword and walks towards the city entrance.“What about the demons?” you ask.He turns to you and a slight grin appears on his face.“Demons? I welcome them with open arms. The city could use some heating up.”With that, he leaves. It’s just you and the dead silence of the night. You try to stand still and focus on the dirt road leading away from the city. This road is where nearby demon sightings have occurred. A few minutes past and you swear you saw a red flash. Your hands shake and your heart beat slows down. Is your mind just playing tricks on you? Surely you’re just reacting to the cold, right?Mere moments after this thought you hear a laugh. Unlike what you were expecting, this isn’t the laugh of some badass demon. No, it’s the laugh of a female. You try to tighten your grip on your sword but can’t move your fingers. Shit, maybe Lars had the right idea. Spending the night out here is a death sentence, regardless if demons attack.You can’t bear to stand any longer and lower yourself to the ground. You drop your sword and curl into a ball. You don’t have the energy to move a muscle and your body becomes stiff. Your eyes shut close and you’re out cold seconds later.“What’s a strong soldier like you doing out here all alone?” a soothing voice inquires.You open your eyes to find yourself staring at barely clothed succubus. She radiates an intense heat, although it’s not enough to burn.“Who are you?” you ask.“My name’s Catia and you never answered my question. Why are you all alone?”“My other guard, Lars, left. Look there’s his sword right there,” you say, feeling compelled to give more information than necessary.Catia walks towards his sword and picks it up.“Is this supposed to kill me? Ha! Don’t make me laugh. Why is your equipment so poor?”You see no logical reason to tell a demon this but find yourself doing so instinctively.“Ever since demons came near our city, trade has been impossible. We have no experience with a threat this large and thus don’t have the weapons or equipment to deal with it.”She grins and salivates to your every word. You take a moment to stare at her figure. She looks more human than succubi are told to be. Still, there are a few stark differences. These being her bright red eyes, dark red curled horns, and pink tail. Oh, and she utterly beautiful. More so than any human you’ve seen. Despite being face to face demon for the first in your life, you feel entirely calm. Dare you say, the calmest you’ve ever felt.This calmness is ripped away when she begins to leave.“Where are you going?”“Hm? You want me stay huh?”“Yes… I do.”She grins again and starts chewing on her tail in a seductive manner.“Sorry, no can do. But if you want, I would love to see you again. Trust me, it will be the most pleasurable experience of your life. All you have to do for me is one small favor.”You feel an intense compulsion to comply with her every demand, but you stop yourself. Making deals with demons is serious business. You have enough willpower to at least ask what the favor is.She explains how if you want to meet again you need to be a more suggestive state, like you are right now due to the cold. She recommends going to a bar and drinking for a few hours. Then, all you have to do is whisper her name and she will come visit, provided that you’re alone.She walks away leaving you all alone. As if in a trance, you make your way to The Drunk Tortoise Tavern.\n",

      "“This is the last time I’m saying this Greg, immortality is not worth cutting off your cock. What’s the point of being immortal if you’re deprived of the best feeling in the world?”“Ey’ maybe he’s lacking in that area. No wonder he wants immortality if all he has to do his cut off an inch or two worth of pecker.”Greg suddenly stands up, drawing your eyes to the bickering trio. They’ve been arguing random hypotheticals since you’ve gotten here. All you wanted was to get a quiet drink before meeting with Catia. As long as these buffoons are here, that’s impossible.Even as Greg stands up he’s shorter than the other two sitting. It’s no wonder they pick on him, he looks pathetic.“Can you both just shut the fuck up? I mean, god damn. All I’m saying is living forever outweighs the downsides of not having a dick,” he says in a whiny voice.The other two laugh uncontrollably at his pitiful attempt of defiance. One manages to calm down and spits out,“Maybe when it’s smaller than a gnome’s toothbrush, but for the rest us it’s not so easy.”Queue more uncontrollable laughter as Greg’s face becomes redder than demon blood.“I’ll shove a gnome’s toothbrush up your ass if you say that one more time! C’mon, let’s move on to another question.”The trio quiets down and you zone them out. You take a swig of whisky and start to remember the reason while you’re here. Oh yeah, the succubus. She wanted you to drink a bit before meeting her. You didn’t necessarily jump at the idea of getting drunk before meeting with a demon, but she promised you she would make it worthwhile. You’re pretty sure that means…Your thoughts are interrupted by the thickheaded trio once again.“You’re telling me you’d prefer your child be retarded and kind than ingenious and mean?”“Yes Connor, I would.”“God damn it, Greg! You want to spend an eternity with no dick while taking care of a retarded child? Pathetic. I would kill myself after a week.”“Har har har! I would kill myself in a week if I had to live Greg’s life as it is. No, scratch that, a day!”“Fuck you Tom. I can’t be the only one who thinks this…”Greg glances around nervously looking for a savior. Eventually he turns his gaze towards you and his eyes light up.“Hey you over there! What would you rather have, a dumb, but kind child; or a smart, but cruel child?” he says while pointing at you.You stare blankly ahead and breathe a deep sigh. This is beyond stupid. You briefly consider just ignoring him and getting the hell out of this place.“Why do you think that man would agree with you? He’s a soldier. Surely, he recognizes the benefits a genius could provide for society. Especially when you consider the need for mages regarding the growing demon problem.”Soldier? Shit you forgot to change out of your uniform. So much for staying inconspicuous. You can thank your lucky stars none of the other guards are here to see you in this shithole.“Now now, let the man speak. Just because he’s a soldier doesn’t mean he agrees with you,” says Tom.“Fine, what do you think...and hurry up! We don’t have all day.”\n",

      "“Thank you,” Greg whispers.“You what!”“Pfft! And to think, I used to respect soldiers.”Tom and Connor start shouting about how much of a dumbass you are. You don’t bother to engage with such idiotic banter. Instead, you walk out of the tavern without a second glance. As you make your way outside you are hit with a rush of cool air.“I can’t wait to meet Catia,” you mutter to yourself.“Who’s Catia?”You turn around and only see the entrance to the tavern.“Hello?”“Ermm down here sir!”You glance down and instantly recoil. It’s Greg, what’s he doing here?“What the hell do you want?”He begins to squirm uncomfortably and hyperventilate.“I…uh…I…erm…”“Spit it out!”“I wanted to thank you for agreeing with me,” he says between irregular gasps for air.Oh, that’s why he’s here. You normally wouldn’t mind but you have plans tonight and have no time for conversation.  “People don’t agree with you often kid? That’s too bad,” you say while walking away.“I’m not a kid, I’m 20. But yeah, everyone I meet either ignores or makes fun of me. I almost prefer the latter as at least they keep me company,”  he says while following behind you.“Damn that really sucks,” you stop walking and stare him in the eyes, “Look I’d love to keep you company, but I have somewhere very important to be.”Greg looks at you with a face of disappointment. But he lights up to ask,“Where do you have to be? Maybe I could come with you.”Gah! As bad as you feel for Greg, under no circumstances could he come with you. She agreed to see you, not Greg and you.“Sorry I don’t have time.”“God damn it. Can you at least tell me why? I don’t want to be near Connor and Tom right now. They make me feel inhuman.”Does this guy ever shut up? You been trying to exit this conversation gracefully since it started. You should just tell him to fuck off and be done it. Of course, you could humor him and tell him what you’re doing. It’s been hard keeping this succubus thing a secret and having someone to confide in wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. On the other hand, you really want to go have demon sex.\n",

      "“My man!” shouts Connor.“Har har Greg probably wants a retarded child to have someone finally agree with him,” Tom jokes.Tom and Connor start shouting about how much of a dumbass Greg is. You agree, but don’t join in on the berating. Instead, you walk out of the tavern without a second glance. As you make your way outside you are hit with a rush of cool air.“I can’t wait to meet Catia,” you mutter to yourself.You tuck your hands in your pockets and begin the walk to your home. On the way, you bump into a familiar face. It’s Lars.“How did last night go?” he asks.Something about Lars is rubbing you the wrong way. It might be his emotionless eyes or his downtrodden tone, but you feel like telling him about Catia is a bad idea“I nearly froze to death,” you say, wanting to be vague.“Yeah how exactly did you avoid doing that? When I left it looked like you were about to pass out.”“Just lucky I guess.”“Lucky huh? Well it’s your ‘luck’ that got me fired. Thanks a lot, now my family can starve to death before getting killed by demons.”You remain silent.“The captain chewed my ass out for quitting guard duty. I thought he would berate me and give me a warning, but he fucking fired me. I told him how much bullshit that was because I would have frozen to death otherwise. He told me I was lazy and incompetent because ‘the other guard didn’t complain’ as if your dumbass was smart to stay.”You try to apologize but Lars is having none of it. He gets angry and says,“I pray to god the demons invade and gut you and the captain like fish. Scrape out your insides with their claws and your other insides with their dick.”“Jesus man I said I was sorry.”“Sorry doesn’t feed my family. Get out of my way, I’m gonna’ drink until I die.”You move aside as Lars storms past you. Well, that was an interesting encounter. You don’t even know what to think, were you wrong to lie to him? How would he have reacted if you told him the truth? You push these thoughts out of your head and focus on getting home. It’s super cold and you don’t want to freeze to death and not have a succubus save you.You find yourself exiting out of the slums and into the residential part of the city. Most guards sleep in the barracks, however, since your parents never returned from their trip their house is all yours. If they ever return, you hope they don’t mind you bringing a demon inside the house. Although, they were always bugging you about finding a girlfriend, this might not be what they had in mind.You arrive at your parent’s old home and open the door. The wooden door squeaks loudly as you open it.“Some things never change,” you whisper to yourself.You immediately start making yourself more presentable. You change out of your soldiers’ uniform and put on a loose-fitting black tunic. You probably should take a bath but you're too excited to see Catia that you forget to. Do demons mind odor?You’re about to sit down in your bed when a chill runs down your spin. Your door makes a squeaking noise and a cold breeze rushes towards you.“Is somebody there?” you ask.No reply, although you don’t know what you were expecting. It’s possible the breeze pushed the door open, it's pretty flimsy and it wouldn’t be the craziest thing that’s happened in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, you can’t shake the feeling your being watched. Should you grab your sword and investigate?\n",

      "“Fine I’ll tell you why. But be warned, it’s a long story.”“That’s alright, the longer I’m away from the other two the better.”You take a deep breath and begin to describe your recent encounter with a succubus.“Well it all started when I fell asleep during guard duty.”Later“And that’s why I came to this tavern.”Greg looks off in the distance, taking in everything you’ve told him. He starts speaking aloud slowly asking,“Do you think she was immortal?”Immortal? Aren’t all demons immortal, unless killed? You’re no expert, but you have never heard of a demon dying of old age.“I don’t have a clue to be honest. I was under the impression that her actual age is much more than her physical appearance would suggest though.”Greg gives a nod satisfied with your answer. You feel like you’ve told Greg more than enough and decide it’s time to go. You wish him goodbye and feel a hint of longing in his response.“Goodbye friend.”You tuck your hands in your pockets and begin the walk to your home. You’re going to have to get home fast as the cold is unbearable. You decide to take the alleys, as not only is it faster, but it also provides protection from the wind.Common sense says going through alleys at night isn’t safest, but Ashton is different than most cities. Crime is low, and poverty is uncommon as anyone can get a job as a guard as demand is higher than ever. The night’s sky combined with the tight spaced alley nearly blinds you. When you finally get out you’re relieved to have arrived at your parents’ house.Most guards sleep in the barracks, however, since your parents never returned from their trip their house is all yours.

Do demons mind odor? You feel like this is your purpose. It’s time to see Catia.“Catia”.A dark cloud appears in your room, dispelling a toxic fume. You start violently coughing as you vision blurs indiscriminately. Your eyes shut close and you feel you grip on reality slipping away from you. “Ah shit,” you whisper before passing out. Your eyes jitter open and you’re greeted by Catia stroking your face. Her palm flushes the coolness off your face. Beads of sweat drip furiously down your neck as she continues caressing you. “Couldn’t wait a single day before seeing me again? How cute.” She crawls onto your bed and moves closer to you. Her aura is all consuming and you feel your free will being drained away. Yet, the whole process is extremely pleasing to you. She moves her mouth to your ear and whispers,“Do you want to see everything I have to offer?”You bite your tongue to avoid instinctively shouting yes. This may be your last chance to not go through with this. At the very least, it would give you chance to ask her a few more questions.   \n",

But then you realize it's Greg and feel a bit better.“Your fault, not mine.

This pays of as you notice a shadowy figure standing outside your bedroom. Is that…Lars?“Your senses are very good, demon. I knew you were possessed, how else could you have heard me?”“The annoying door squeak, for one. Also, it's fucking freezing so I knew someone let in the cold.”“More lies! First you tell me you survived the cold from pure luck, now you tell me your heighten senses are nothing special?“Lars, you have no idea what you’re talking about.”“Stop pretending, I know your secret.

It all started once you left…”Later “So that’s why you were at the drunk tortoise? I admit, you’ve never been one to drink.”“Exactly! I’m glad you understand.”“What now? You’re going to come clean to the captain and convince him to give me back my job, right?While the captain may give Lars his job back, you would probably be fired. Coming into direct contact with a demon and living to tell the tale is a no go. He’ll probably think you made some sort of deal to avoid being killed. Regardless of what you plan to do, you say,“I will definitely do that tomorrow.”Lars nods but still looks a little unhinged. His hand twitches and he gives you a half grin.“Ok I’m holding you to it, because if you don’t, you’re gonna wish you froze to death last night.”You gulp as you have no doubt Lars could kill you if he wanted. He leaves and you hear the door squeak once again. The cold breeze has expanded throughout your house and you could use some heating up. After securing to house to make sure Lars isn’t still lurking, you fall into bed.You’re super tired and debate whether you still want to see Catia. It’s been a long day and if you have any intention of talking to your captain tomorrow, you should go to sleep.\n",

      "The trio begins arguing again. Something about how demon immortality is different than regular immortality. You don’t have time to dwell on it and make your way home. You find yourself grinning the whole walk back. This isn’t just a happy drunk feeling. You feel like this is your purpose. It’s time to see Catia.You find yourself exiting out of the slums and into the residential part of the city. Most guards sleep in the barracks, however, since your parents never returned from their trip their house is all yours. If they ever return, you hope they don’t mind you bringing a demon inside the house. Although, they were always bugging you about finding a girlfriend, this might not be what they had in mind. You arrive at your parent’s old home and turn the door knob. The wooden door squeaks loudly as you open it. “Some things never change,” you whisper to yourself.You immediately start making yourself more presentable. You change out of your soldiers’ uniform and put on a loose-fitting black tunic. You probably should take a bath but you're too excited to see Catia that you forget to. Do demons mind odor? “Catia.”A dark cloud appears in your room, dispelling a toxic fume. You start violently coughing as your vision blurs indiscriminately. Your eyes shut close and you feel you grip on reality slipping away from you.“Ah shit,” you whisper before passing out.Your eyes jitter open and you’re greeted by Catia stroking your face. Her palm flushes the coolness off your face. Beads of sweat drip furiously down your neck as she continues caressing you.“Couldn’t wait a single day before seeing me again? How cute.”She crawls onto your bed and moves closer to you. Her aura is all consuming and you feel your free will being drained away. Yet, the whole process is extremely pleasing to you. She moves her mouth to your ear and whispers,“Do you want to see everything I have to offer?”You bite your tongue to avoid instinctively shouting yes. This may be your last chance to not go through with this. At the very least, it would give you chance to ask her a few more questions. \n",

      "She takes no time to hesitate and begins kissing you. As she does so, she unties your tunic and throws it off. Her warm body pushes against your bare skin as you are filled with euphoria.Soon both of you are completely naked. Catia pleases you in ways no other woman has or will ever be able to. Afterwards you both lay in bed panting as one thought races through your mind.How do you get more of this?1 Month LaterIt’s been a month since you’ve started having sex with Catia on a regular basis. The first few times you felt great afterwards. However, lately she has been demanding more out of you.First, you no longer have to say her name to see her. She visits you most nights whether you like her to or not. Last night she told you she wants to introduce you to a group: The Order of the Inferno. She told you they are a group of demons who could give you unimaginable powers in exchange for your help.  You protested as you feared what could happen. Demon attacks are becoming more common and more lethal. Their reputation proceeds them and stomps out any curiosity you have of meeting one.  Tales of rape, human consumption, and slavery are a few of many horrendous acts they have committed.Yet, as always, she managed to convince you. As much as your mind tries to resist, her presence is intoxicating. You embrace it as fighting gets you nowhere. She tells you to meet you in a nearby forest tonight. This is the first time you're seeing her outside your bedroom since the day you met. You sneak out the city walls when no one is watching and blend into the shadows.Although it is still winter, the temperature has unexpectedly risen. Some say its because of demonic power, others view it as being coincidence. Whatever it is, the cold will not be a hindrance. You reach the edge of the forest and feel your heart leaping out of your chest. While the city has many focused-on demons, other creatures lurk during the night. Just because Catia is on your side doesn’t mean you are safe. You keep this in mind as you take cover in bushes and flora periodically.An intense red light comes into view causing you to close your eyes. You begin to stumble and fall to the ground. When you’re able to open your eyes, you find yourself staring up at a hooded figure.“Who dares disturb me?” she hisses.Behind a dark brown hood lies a demonic face. Compared to Catia, she is clearly not human. Although none of that matters now, you begin to explain,“Catia told me to come here. Are you part of The Inferno Order?”“She sent a human to the center of The Order of the Inferno! I guess she wants to make up for earlier. I could never turn down a good meal.”She begins advancing towards you as a snake-like tongue hangs out of her mouth.‘Wait! She told me you wanted my help and would give me powers in exchange.”She begins to laugh as she towers over you. You’re helpless as she grabs your neck and leans in… to kiss you?“My kiss is to die for!”You surprise yourself when you send a punch flying at her mouth. She seems equally surprised as she falls backwards.“I guess I can still resist,” you say.You get up and start running away but it's no use. She’s much faster than you, especially considering she can fly. You don’t have many options left but need to decide quick. Do you run deeper in the forest and hope to lose her or run back to the city and put everyone at risk?\n",

      "That’s the last thing you do before passing. Between your shuttered eyes you can make out one last thing.An even bigger smile on Lars’ face.The next time you wake up your chained in darkness. You can still reach around a fair bit and waste no time exploring your surroundings by touch. When you get to your face you find it hastily wrapped in gauze and bandages. You shallow and taste dried up blood sticking to your mouth like honey. You really need a drink. With nobody around you start banging your chains against the ground. It makes a loud rattling sound that will surely attract anyone close by.Nothing. Wherever you are nobody is here. Although, you assume Lars will be back soon. That is, unless he was killed as raving mad men often are. As you sit here hungry, tired, and thirsty you rack your mind trying to remember anything that can help you. Your head pounds with each thought, it feels like a hangover but a 100 time worse. Getting whack in the head may have some long-lasting effect on your mental capabilities.After a few minutes of fruitless concentration, it hits you. The thing that got you into this mess is what will get you out; Catia. While the alcohol has mostly worn off, your injuries have left you in a susceptible state. Assuming she wasn’t lying when she said she would meet you again, she should be able to get you out of this mess. You can’t believe you need a demon to rescue you, but you have no choice.“Catia,” you whisper.A few seconds pass and despair creeps in. Just before you lose all hope a dark cloud appears in the room. It dispels a nauseous fume that ferociously attacks your lungs. You start violently coughing more blood, mostly dry, as you vision blurs. Your eyes shut close and you feel your grip on reality slipping away.You awaken to find yourself in a metallic cage. This room is much brighter than the one before.“When I saw you chained I figured a cage would make you feel right at home.”It’s Catia and you’re getting a very different vibe from her than last time. Your gut tells you to do what she says as you are powerless.“Now tell me, how come I wasn’t the first one to put you in chains?” she says while licking her lips.“It’s not like it was consensual. I was blindsided and nearly died.”She gives you a playful smile and whispers in to your ear“Tell me everything and don’t spare any details.Seeing as you don’t have much of a choice you describe everything that’s occurred since you last saw her. You don’t withhold even the most irrelevant details.“It’s nice to know you believe I exist. I know it’s hard to believe someone this beautiful isn’t a figment of your imagination.”Her red eyes pierce into your mind, daring you to think otherwise.“So, what do you think we should do about Lars?” you ask.She starts laughing to herself.“What?”She walks towards your cage and reaches inside. She puts her hand on your chin and points your head upwards. She locks eyes with you and grins widely“You’re going to kill the captain!”LaterIt took a lot less convincing that you thought it would. Something about Catia just makes you want to obey her, though this time around you didn’t have much choice. She didn’t give you a reason other than saying“Chaos sows the seeds of discontent.”Which if you agree with this line of thinking, you are only helping the infernal realm by following Catia. Her influence is so strong you didn’t consider any other option. Or maybe you just really want to fuck her. Either way, time to kill the captain.After releasing you from your cage, she offers to heal you with dark magic. You agree, as you can barely move let alone assassinate someone. What you didn’t know is that another demon would be performing the ritual.“Why is a human stinking up the place?”“Mind your manners, Jirzan. Someone finally wants you for your magic and you treat them like this?”“Heh I guess you got a point. They don’t call me Jirzan the Lunatic for nothing. Alright tell me what you need me to do.”She whispers into his ear and is too quiet to understand. Though you make out words such as “transform” and painful.What exactly do they plan on doing to you? Perhaps you should try backing out of this whole ritual.\n",

      "You close your eyes and drift off to sleep. You dream of a bright forest with playing children. Everything is nice and everyone is happy. Then one day that changes when a portal to another dimension appears in the middle of the forest. Out of the portal comes abominations to mankind. A collection of arms and legs attached on to a giant ball of flesh. This ball rolls around destroying the forest, killing everyone and growing stronger as it does so. The ball then comes rolling at you. You don’t have time to scream before…You jolt awake and find yourself covered in sweat. As much as you hate nightmares, they do a great job at waking you up. You look outside your window and notice the sun rising. This rising ball of fire reminds you of the ball from your dream. You throw on a clean pair of clothes, grab your sword just in case, and make your way to the captain’s quarters.It’s an uneventful journey and you arrive within a few minutes. Not wanting to wake the captain, you pull out pen and paper. It goes as follows,Dear Captain Dario,I am writing to you regarding the firing of guard Lars. I was on the same shift as him before he left. The windchill was approaching deadly levels and he decided to head inside as a last resort. I stayed out only because I feared the repercussions. As I sat out there, my muscles began to freeze until I could no longer move. I passed out minutes later.I would have surely died had a traveling merchant not stopped by. They started a fire and warmed me up. I would have died otherwise and thank the heavens a demon didn’t wander by. Due to my own experiences, I recommend you rehire Lars and if anything, fire me for putting my life on the line when it wasn’t needed.You are in such a rush that you slide the letter under the door before signing it. You decided against telling the truth as Captain Dario is a hard ass for rules. Not only would you have been fired, but also forced to undergo a purging to ward off any demonic influences.With that out of the way, you decide to head to a local armory. Your city issued sword is no match for a demon, as Catia pointed out. Not knowing if your parents will ever return, you see no problem with using their savings for your protection. You take a stroll to the armory and find it to be quite crowded for this early in the morning.“I need something that can scare away demons,” a farmer says“Scare away? Why not something that can kill?”“Look son, I’ve never been one to resort to violence. I just need something to protect you and the Misses.”You zone out their conversation and take a look around. They have swords, maces, axes, and even a trident. However, what catches your eyes is a bow painted red and black. It’s the only one in the store and seems rare.“Excuse me sir, what’s the price on this bow?”“That would be 500 gold sir,” replies a dwarf with steel encrusted teeth.“What’s so special about it?”“We brought it from a dark elf mercenary. They have great craftsmanship, especially when it comes to bows.”“How is it different than all the other bows for sale?”He pauses and turns red,“I hate to admit it, but I’ve always struggled making bows. That red and black one has much finer strings and sturdier wood, giving it a greater firing range.”You thank the dwarf for the information and continue looking around. Nothing else catches your eye, so you decide to buy the bow.“Pleasure doing business with ya.”You leave with your new bow and 500 gold poorer. You hope you still have your guard job as your parent’s money won’t last much longer. You go to the guard barracks and decide to get a meal there. Even if you’ve been fired, you doubt any of the servers will know. You arrive to a mess hall and find it more empty than usual. Two men eat soup together and another man sits alone.You grab a cup of soup and take another look around. You recognize the two men sitting together as Herbert and Andy. Herbert is an older man with a gray beard who has always been kind to you. Andy is around your age, mid twenties, and is already going bald. Both are good chaps and would be happy if you sat with them.The man sitting alone is someone you don’t recognize. He is a very thin fellow with patchy hair and missing teeth. You could try to find out who he is, or sit with Herbert and Andy.\n",

      "“Fuck all of you, let’s talk about something else. Bartender! Get me another drink,” you say.A couple hours later.“All I’m saying is it’s a bit hypocritical to complain about demons capturing human when we capture orc children on the regular.”“What do you mean we? Last time I checked you’re the only one in the army,” says Tom.“Yeah plus it’s different. Orcs are uncivilized barbarians who kill all those they meet. When’s the last time a human killed a demon unprovoked?” asks Connor.“Did you forget how this whole demon war started? We tried to wipe them off the face of the earth and they retaliated. Jeez Connor, you say orcs are barbarians, but I’ve met orcs smarter than you,” Greg says.Connor slams his fist on the table making everyone jump a little bit. Although all he says is,“Yeah, I’m sure you have.”Connor has been a lot less hostile to Greg since you came here. It’s probably because Greg finally has someone who agrees with him on some issues. Oh, and the fact you could kick Connor’s ass without breaking a sweat.The three of you continue discussing the demon war and the implications it as on the empire. Recent news of the capital being overrun has set the whole empire into a panic. You begin discussing the possibility of fleeing the city before its too late.“I don’t have much confidence in Ashton keeping us safe, but it’s more protection than outside the city walls,” you state.“I don’t want to wait here to die,” Connor says while slurring his words.“You must know better than anyone being a soldier and all. Do you think the city guards could even kill a single demon? I know it’s just rumors, but word says our army is ill-equip to fight in the winter, let alone against demons.”How the hell does a guy like Tom know that? You stare at him trying to gain insight into his mind, but all he does in shrug. Damn, might as well give him your honest opinion.“I’ve never seen a demon. Well, other than that succubus and she wasn’t fighting me.”“So, is that a yes or no you bitch?” slurs Connor.“I don’t know.”There is an awkward silence as you all realize how up in the air the future of this city is. The capital was supposed to send reinforcements to any city that sighted demons. Though with it being under siege that possibility lessens by the minute.“Has anyone even seen a demon? I mean—” Connor says before downing another drink.“Has your dumbass forgot already? This man right here saw a succubus!” Greg says.Finally, someone believes you. Perhaps he agreed with you from the beginning and was too scared to admit it?“Like I said before, it was probably just a hallucination. Plus, why would succubi be needed to conquer the city?” Tom says.Just as you're about to answer that the question a man walks in the tavern. You turn to see who it is and wish you hadn’t.It’s Lars.It’s inevitable he notices you and when he does, he wastes no time telling you why he’s here. He got caught abandoning his guard duty last night and has been let go. When he tried to argue how unfair that was because he lacked equipment to handle the conditions all he was told was.“That’s your own damn fault! The other guard did it without complaint.”He came here to drink until he passed out. Without the money from his guard job he has no way to support his family. He appears a bit more unhinged than usual because of that.“I fucking hope the demons break down the city walls and storm the captain’s quarters. I don’t care what happens next. All I want is for him suffer a slow and painful death. That’s what he sent me to last night and blamed me for saving myself.”You sit in silence not knowing what to say. He continues,“Speaking of which how the hell did you survive last night? When I left it looked like you were about to pass out.”Well he’s got that right. You briefly consider telling him about your encounter with Catia but the rabid look in his eyes tells you that’s not a good idea.“Just lucky I guess.”He doesn’t second guess you and continues his rambling. You pay little attention to his words and when you do it’s clear he’s gone off the rails.“Then they’ll rape his family and have him watch. It’s what he fucking deserves, and he deserves what he’s going to get.”As Lars drones on and on you realize how late it’s getting. You better go home and get the hell away from this guy. You tell him you must go, and he just continues on talking to himself. It’s like he doesn’t know you’re here.That’s probably for the best. As you leave you give him one last look, and he looks back at you with a huge smile and twitchy eyes. That’s creepy. You make your way out of the tavern and are hit by the freezing winter breeze. You’re going to have to get home fast lest you pass out again. Best to take the alleys as not only is it faster, but it also provides protection from the wind.You don’t even get a few steps before you tumble to the ground, but not because of the cold. You are whacked in the back of the head with a glass. You fall face first, mouth agape, breaking teeth instantly. Blood seeps out of your head as you press your hand on the back of your skull. It’s more caved in than usual.You start hearing laughter. This isn’t your first time hearing it either.“As if I believed you survived by pure luck. You’re lucky I don’t just kill you now. Now tell me the truth, demon!”It’s Lars and he looks completely unhinged. You try to say something but just start coughing blood. It comes out in chunks resembling mushy cherries.“You really thought you could get away with it, didn’t you? HAHAHAHA! I know you’ve been possessed by a demon; how else could you survive the frigid cold?”Clumps of blood continue flying out of your mouth as you fail to speak. Lars crotches down next to you and strokes your face.“It’s ok, calm down. Like I told you before, or at least the non-possessed you, the city could use some heating up.”Where is this going?“I want to make a deal with you! Kill the Captain and I’ll let you live. Hell, I’ll even give you something in exchange. Perhaps a part of my soul? If there’s anything left in there.”Your vision blurs as Lars grins widely at you. Saliva drips down his face like a feral beast.“Decide now! Don’t make me kill you to reveal your true self.”\n",

      "You pump your muscles and start running back to the city walls. She follows you like a hawk, soaring above you with her wings. Once she’s directly above she swoops in. Too late though as you bolt through the city entrance. You keep running straight and dive into a nearby bush. You stop breathing and don’t dare move. You can sense that she is nearby, but she doesn’t seem to be trying to kill you anymore. Instead, you hear screaming in a nearby house followed by laughing.Curiosity gets the better of you and you peak out from the bushes. You spot her in a house cornering a family. You know demons are monsters, but what benefit is there to killing innocent children and their parents? It’s senseless, what’s the point of destruction for destruction sake? You continue starring at her as she slashes the throat of presumably a father. But for some reason, she does not kill him.What she does is much worse. She leaves him alive to watch as she sends a ball of red energy at the children. It renders them into ash, not giving them a chance to scream. You curse at yourself for indirectly causing this. Why did you listen to a demon anyways? You keep watching in nervous anticipation of her killing the father. Instead, she just leaves. What cruelty propels such an atrocious action? This man has lost all that’s dear to him, and she left him alive.You stay in the bushes as she goes from house to house committing similar acts of violence. There must be a stop to the madness. You gather the courage to leave your bush haven. You dash away back to your home and fling the door open. Your immediately reaction is to get your sword and leather armor to slay the demon. Yet, the logical side of your mind tells you that’s suicide. There's another way, although you don’t want to admit it. What if you got drunk and contacted Catia to save your city?

Great job!”She tells you things along the same lines until you're completely devoid of any clothing.“Now here comes the fun part, get on your hands and knees.”You’ve already come this far, might as well comply. You get down and have to arch your back to stare up at her. The uncomfortable position does not bother you as all you can focus on is her figure. Damn she sure is beautiful. Especially when she says incantations. Hey, that’s what she’s saying right now!”“Sarahkahnar Hor zeef narze taf!”When she finishes you have a out of body experience. It’s like you're having an orgasm all over your body. Yet, it’s so much more than just that. Your whole room is having an organism and you feel it all. The walls, the table, the bed, and even clumps of dust experience this sensation along side you. It’s magical and you don’t care if she’s a so called demon, she is a blessing to this world. You can’t keep this feeling inside and whisper,“I love…”You pass out before finishing from pure ecstasy. When you regain consciousness you feel utterly cold. You’re naked as Catia towers over you.\"Saying the word 'love' after our first night together tells me all I need to know about you.\"\"What's that?\"She grows quiet and says in a pitiful tone,\"You're too weak-willed to be of any real use to me. Best I throw away the trash before it makes my presence known.\"You try to question her but find yourself unable to move. A white spirit begins to flow out of your body.\"Don't think I'm taking your soul or anything. I'm merely releasing you from your human form.\"Soon everything turns black as you find yourself floating in infinite space. Other floating spirits whiz around, but you're unable to communicate with any of them. You never escape this purgatory and soon forget how you got here.

You feel the sweat drip down your back when she finally says,“Maybe I really deserved to be sent here. I can’t even manipulate a human into having sex with me.”A black cloud appears as she disappears from your room. You start violently coughing but don’t pass out this time. It’s not like it matters, you need to sleep anyway. You put out your candles and fall into bed. You focus on your breathing as you drift off to sleep. Best to reflect on what happens when you have a clearer mind.You wake up with a throbbing pain in your head. The light coming from your window floods your mind with intense pain. Guess you drunk more last night than you thought. You decide its best to make yourself some food and drink to clear your head. You grab water and a slice of peach pie you made a few days ago. You scarf the food down and shallow the water in huge gulps. Your head should start feeling better within the next few hours.Except it doesn’t, you lie in bed with constant tension on your head. It’s like someone is squeezing your brain with both hands, but not hard enough to cause physical harm. Something unnatural is going on and you know it. Hangovers should get better after rest, not worse. It’s hard to focus on anything but the pain. You try remembering what Catia did before she left. She dispelled a black cloud which didn’t knock you out. Is it possible this was a curse?The more you think about it, the more it makes sense. While she tried not to show it, she was upset you resisted her temptation. She wanted you to pay for hurting her ego. That bitch! As you think about her more, tension is released from your skull. In fact, you're able to think about her in vivid detail and feel headache free. Although, the second you stop thinking about her the pain comes rushing back. This certainly isn’t good.You’re going to have to do something about this. There is one obvious solution which is trying to contact Catia and having her remove the curse. Though who knows if she’ll even remove it, assuming she still wants to visit you. The other option is going to a local witch doctor and having them remove the curse. Although, you’ve heard they’ve been busy since demons first started being sighted. Maybe the curse is temporary, why not wait it out?\n",

      "Catia asks you to join hands with Jirzan and her. Once you do, they begin chanting nonsensical words. Their eyes roll into the back of their heads and their bodies go limp. After a few seconds they get up and it’s now you that’s limp. You feel excruciating pain course through your veins. Your skin burns, and it feels like fire ants are crawling in your eyes.You can’t help but scream as every part of your body feels like hell, literally. Your skin starts to red and your head feels like it’s being ripped apart. They can’t be doing what you think they’re doing.“The transformation is working!” Jirzan shouts.You begin spazzing out on the floor. This isn’t what you thought she meant by healing you.“Enjoy your new life under my servitude,” Catia laughs.Your body starts contorting as blood spills out of your eyes. You jolt in and out of consciousness while Catia laughs louder. Her voice sounds dreamlike as the room around you morphs into hell. You black out.When you wake up you find Catia and Jirzan shorter than before. In fact, the whole room feels smaller.“There he is!” shouts Jirzan.“How does it feel?” asks Catia.You stare at them in shock.“What did you do to me?’Catia approaches you differently than before. She no longer seems to be trying to seduce you. Rather, she carries a wave of supremacy not present before.“You will obey my commands as long as I live. Now, get on your knees,” she says.You try to protest, but find your whole body paralyzed. You assume this must be some sort of magic forcing you to obey. This however is not the case as she makes clear.“WHY AREN’T YOU MOVING?”“It seems like my ritual may have had some unintended effects.”Your body goes into an epileptic seizure as they start arguing over the ritual. None of that matter to you as your heart can’t support your new body. The world becomes a blur as you hear one last thing,“Great, I’ll never return home now that he’s dead.”While you aren’t dead yet, you will be soon. Your tale ends here.\n",

      "“Hey uh guys, I don’t know about this. I think it would be best if I just heal the natural way.”Jirzan turns towards you and hisses.“You insolent fool! You dare turn the opportunity to become a demon, what else do you have going for you in life?”You instinctively start backing away as he gets angrier.“Is it my epithet ‘Lunatic’ that scares you? You humans disgust me. If that scares you I couldn’t imagine what you’d think about the meaning of my first name.”Well his epithet played a role, but dark magic frightens you more. Now you’re curious about his first name and don’t hesitate in asking him,“What does Jirzan mean?”He does a little dance and is excited to share,“Enslaver. My full name means translates to Enslaver the Lunatic. As a shorthand, ‘Deranged Enslaver’ works as well.”He’s known as an Enslaver? Kind of ironic seeing as he is doing Catia’s bidding. How did he plan to enslave you with dark magic? Does dark magic break demonic rule or did he have no intent on subjugating you?“Were you planning to enslave me? How can you just do that, doesn’t a deal have to be made?”“A deal? Why do you think I was banished to earth? I don’t do deals and see no reason why I should. All I need is your consent to use dark magic and I can do whatever I want.”Looks like you dodge a bullet. Although, you’re still confused about this whole banishment to earth. You thought demons were mounting a full-scale invasion. You bring up your confusion and that only causes him to laugh at you.“You think I would be near humans willingly? The only reason I’m here is because dark magic is outlawed in hell. Demons tend to stray away from things they don’t understand”“Same reason I’m here,” adds Catia.If not here by free-will, what explains the siege of the capital? How would a bunch of misfits pose a threat to the elite empiric army? As you to reason through it, your brain aches with pain. Damn that hit from Lars got you good.“Well if he doesn’t want to go through with the ritual then my work here is done,” says Jirzan.“Not so fast!” says Catia.“Eh? Do you want me to kill him or something? I thought you could use the practice.”Catia sighs and places her hand on hip whist saying,“What about instead of turning him into a demon we make him a Doom Knight? All you’d have to do is teach him a little dark magic and we should be all set.”You don’t even know what a Doom Knight is and still don’t trust Jirzan to teach you.“You think this imbecile could handle learning the dark arts? You have truly gone mad! And to think, they call me the lunatic.”“C’mon Zan, you owe me this. Backing out will only lead to more consequences down the road.”This seems to shut him up real quick. He starts cursing as it becomes clear to you Catia has something he dearly wants.“Fine I’ll do it, under two conditions. The first, I will need his full consent to do the initiation spell. Without it, there is no way he could become a Doom Knight. The second, you return Coyote back to me once I finish.”Catia nods and agrees to his terms. She now turns to you and asks,“Any questions?”\n",

      "She takes no time to hesitate and begins kissing you. As she does so, she unties your tunic and throws it off. Her warm body pushes against your bare skin as you are filled with euphoria.Soon both of you are completely naked. Catia pleases you in ways no other woman has or will ever be able to. Afterwards you both lay in bed panting as one thought races through your mind.How do you get more of this?1 Month LaterIt’s been a month since you’ve started having sex with Catia on a regular basis. The first few times you felt great afterwards. However, lately she has been demanding more out of you.First, you no longer have to say her name to see her. She visits you most nights whether you like her to or not. Last night she told you she wants to introduce you to a group: The Order of the Inferno. She told you they are a group of demons who could give you unimaginable powers in exchange for your help.  You protested as you feared what could happen. Demon attacks are becoming more common and more lethal. Their reputation proceeds them and stomps out any curiosity you have of meeting one.  Tales of rape, human consumption, and slavery are a few of many horrendous acts they have committed.Yet, as always, she managed to convince you. As much as your mind tries to resist, her presence is intoxicating. You embrace it as fighting gets you nowhere. She tells you to meet you in a nearby forest tonight. This is the first time you're seeing her outside your bedroom since the day you met. You sneak out the city walls when no one is watching and blend into the shadows.Although it is still winter, the temperature has unexpectedly risen. Some say its because of demonic power, others view it as being coincidence. Whatever it is, the cold will not be a hindrance. You reach the edge of the forest and feel your heart leaping out of your chest. While the city has many focused-on demons, other creatures lurk during the night. Just because Catia is on your side doesn’t mean you are safe. You keep this in mind as you take cover in bushes and flora periodically.An intense red light comes into view causing you to close your eyes. You begin to stumble and fall to the ground. When you’re able to open your eyes, you find yourself staring up at a hooded figure.“Who dares disturb me?” she hisses.Behind a dark brown hood lies a demonic face. Compared to Catia, she is clearly not human. Although none of that matters now, you begin to explain,“Catia told me to come here. Are you part of The Inferno Order?”“She sent a human to the center of The Order of the Inferno! I guess she wants to make up for earlier. I could never turn down a good meal.”She begins advancing towards you as a snake-like tongue hangs out of her mouth.‘Wait! She told me you wanted my help and would give me powers in exchange.”She begins to laugh as she towers over you. You’re helpless as she grabs your neck and leans in… to kiss you?“My kiss is to die for!”You surprise yourself when you send a punch flying at her mouth. She seems equally surprised as she falls backwards.“I guess I can still resist,” you say.You get up and start running away but it's no use. She’s much faster than you, especially considering she can fly. You don’t have many options left but need to decide quick. Do you run deeper in the forest and hope to lose her or run back to the city and put everyone at risk?\n",

      "You walk over to the skinny man and and ask,“Mind if I sit next to you?”He is startled by your presence and jumps up a bit. He mutters something incomprehensible before saying,“I don’t mind.”The hot soup burns your tongue as you eat a spoonful.“So what’s this town’s name again?”“Ashton, why do you ask?”“You might not believe me, but I came face to face with a demon. When I finally got away, I ran to the city walls.”“Trust me, I believe you. I encountered a demon while on guard duty.”You tell him about how you passed out and met a succubus.“That’s wild.”“Sure is, now tell me about the demon you met.”He grits what few teeth he has and begins,“He wasn’t pleasant at all like the one you met. I was going for a walk in the forest. I know, it’s not the smartest thing to do in times like these, but it's one of my few sanctities.”His voice gets lower as he describes,“I knew something was off the moment I entered. An unholy energy made me feel weak and tired. I started hearing voices and couldn’t tell what was real. It was like I was in a trance.”“Did you actually see a demon?”“No, but he made his presence known. He tired to coerce me into letting him take over my mind. I almost did it too, but something broke me out of my trance.”He pauses for dramatic effect,“A bird fucking shat on my head!”You stare at his head and notice white flakes clumped in his hair.“Once I realized what I was about to do I ran like hell. I wasn’t thinking straight and went the opposite direction which I came in. I’m lucky I ended up here.”His experience is vastly different to your own. You suppose he encountered a demonic sprit, rather than a full fledge demon.“Perhaps this all was for the best. My city was running low on food, hence my frail appearance.”“Are you planning on staying in Ashton?”“I don’t know. I would need to get a job and a place to sleep at night. Would you be able to help me out in any way?”When your about to answer you hear someone call your name. It’s Captain Dario and he wants to speak with you immediately. You get up and tell the thin man,“It was nice talking to you.”“I hope you can come back when you're done. My name’s Eric by the way.”You wave goodbye and follow the captain into his private quarters.A rush of anxiety hits you as your still not sure if the captain bought your story. What if Lars told him the truth?“Please, take a seat.”You sit and find yourself starring at the gray haired captain. He stares back, unblinking as you both wait to see who makes the first move.“First things first, you’re not fired.”“That’s a relief.”“I’m sure it is, but what I say next may not be. I have no intention of re-hiring Lars.”“Wait what? Like I said in my letter, he did the smart thing and could have died had he stayed.”The captain sighs and says,“While that may be true, I’ve been wanting to fire him for awhile. He’s lazy and incompetent. The only reason he still had a job was because guards are in high demand right now. The problem now is finding a replacement.”“What happens if you don’t?”Dario frowns and bitterly says,“Then I might have to rehire Lars.”You could mention your new acquaintance, Eric, and vouch for him to replace Lars. On the other hand, who knows how Lars will react if he finds out you played a role in replacing him. There may be no reasoning with him.\n",

      "You head over to sit with Herbert and Andy and listen in on their conversation.“I can’t believe she would do such a thing,” says Herbert.“I don’t know how she could just lie after all I did for her. She’s been pissed at me ever since we last had sex. I can’t even talk to her anymore.”“I know how you feel, women sure are a pain in the ass. Hey new guy, did you hear what Andy’s girlfriends been doing?”You stop blowing on your soup and glance at Herbert.“I haven’t, what happened?”“So this fucking bitch named, what was her name again Andy?”“Julia.”“Yeah so this bitch named Julia has been spreading lies about him ever since they broke up. She told the captain that he raped her!”“I guess she wants to get me fired. Rather get revenge against me for something I didn’t do then have the city be safe.”“Julia...what’s her last name?”“Why does it matter? She’s a fucking liar and that’s that,” says Andy.“Sorry I thought I might know her...I had a childhood friend named Julia.”“Well I hope you don’t still consider her a friend after what she did to Andy. That skank deserves to live a life alone.”You sit in silence as you take this all in. If this is the Julia you think it is, there’s got to be a reason she said what she said. You never knew her as the type of person to lie, even as a child. When you’re about to prod further, you hear someone call your name.

      "That’s the last thing you do before passing. Between your shuttered eyes you can make out one last thing.An even bigger smile on Lars’ face.The next time you wake up your chained in darkness. You can still reach around a fair bit and waste no time exploring your surroundings by touch. When you get to your face you find it hastily wrapped in gauze and bandages. You shallow and taste dried up blood sticking to your mouth like honey. You really need a drink. With nobody around you start banging your chains against the ground. It makes a loud rattling sound that will surely attract anyone close by.Nothing. Wherever you are nobody is here. Although, you assume Lars will be back soon. That is, unless he was killed as raving mad men often are. As you sit here hungry, tired, and thirsty you rack your mind trying to remember anything that can help you. Your head pounds with each thought, it feels like a hangover but a 100 time worse. Getting whack in the head may have some long-lasting effect on your mental capabilities.After a few minutes of fruitless concentration, it hits you. The thing that got you into this mess is what will get you out; Catia. While the alcohol has mostly worn off, your injuries have left you in a susceptible state. Assuming she wasn’t lying when she said she would meet you again, she should be able to get you out of this mess. You can’t believe you need a demon to rescue you, but you have no choice.“Catia,” you whisper.A few seconds pass and despair creeps in. Just before you lose all hope a dark cloud appears in the room. It dispels a nauseous fume that ferociously attacks your lungs. You start violently coughing more blood, mostly dry, as you vision blurs. Your eyes shut close and you feel your grip on reality slipping away.You awaken to find yourself in a metallic cage. This room is much brighter than the one before.“When I saw you chained I figured a cage would make you feel right at home.”It’s Catia and you’re getting a very different vibe from her than last time. Your gut tells you to do what she says as you are powerless.“Now tell me, how come I wasn’t the first one to put you in chains?” she says while licking her lips.“It’s not like it was consensual. I was blindsided and nearly died.”She gives you a playful smile and whispers in to your ear“Tell me everything and don’t spare any details.Seeing as you don’t have much of a choice you describe everything that’s occurred since you last saw her. You don’t withhold even the most irrelevant details.“It’s nice to know you believe I exist. I know it’s hard to believe someone this beautiful isn’t a figment of your imagination.”Her red eyes pierce into your mind, daring you to think otherwise.“So, what do you think we should do about Lars?” you ask.She starts laughing to herself.“What?”She walks towards your cage and reaches inside. She puts her hand on your chin and points your head upwards. She locks eyes with you and grins widely“You’re going to kill the captain!”LaterIt took a lot less convincing that you thought it would. Something about Catia just makes you want to obey her, though this time around you didn’t have much choice. She didn’t give you a reason other than saying“Chaos sows the seeds of discontent.”Which if you agree with this line of thinking, you are only helping the infernal realm by following Catia. Her influence is so strong you didn’t consider any other option. Or maybe you just really want to fuck her. Either way, time to kill the captain.After releasing you from your cage, she offers to heal you with dark magic. You agree, as you can barely move let alone assassinate someone. What you didn’t know is that another demon would be performing the ritual.“Why is a human stinking up the place?”“Mind your manners, Jirzan. Someone finally wants you for your magic and you treat them like this?”“Heh I guess you got a point. They don’t call me Jirzan the Lunatic for nothing. Alright tell me what you need me to do.”She whispers into his ear and is too quiet to understand. Though you make out words such as “transform” and painful.What exactly do they plan on doing to you? Perhaps you should try backing out of this whole ritual.\n",

      "You must slay the demon yourself. Catia didn’t bother showing up to the forest, why would she help you? You throw on your armor and pick up your sword. You grin at the thought of stabbing this demon to death. You haven’t ever felt pleasure from violence before, yet something tells you you’ll enjoy killing her. With your weapon and protection, you leave your home.Terror has spread like wildfire. Bodies lay on the street charred and bruised.  Your veins pulsate with anger. Why, tell me why? These are your neighbors and friends. You run with each step being more purposeful than the last. After a few hundred steps, you hear laughter. There she is, cornering a group of children. You yell to create a distraction, but she ignores you. The children are reduced to fragments of ember.Destruction lies all around you with more bodies than you could count. You scream a battle cry of hatred and charge. She looks up and makes eye contact but doesn’t move. You resist the urge to strike her down as you know you are outmatched physically. Still, another urge gnaws at your conscious forcing you to spit out,“Why would you do this?”You’re surprised when she stops to think for a moment.“I had everything I held dear to me ripped away. When Catia came to me with the idea of working along side a human, I couldn’t contain my anger.”“What’s wrong with working with a human?”She stares at you with pity.“You truly don’t know? Why the hell are you helping Catia then? I don’t understand.”You are equally confused and explain your relationship with Catia.“Oh, so you’re her fuck toy then? Jesus Christ, she’ll never get back with such degrading tactics.”You ignore her insult (although she said it more like an objective statement) and ask her,“What do you mean get back? Demons invaded earth, why wouldn’t they want to finish the job?”“You think we’re here willingly? Holy shit you’re brain dead, I still can’t get over Catia fucking a human as dumb as you. It would be like if you had sex with a jellyfish, completely different wavelengths.”This hellish creature is relentless with her insults. Though it seems there is a fundamental misunderstanding between you two.“If you’re not here by choice, why are you here?”She explains that there is a demonic code in the infernal realm. Any demons who break it, are sent to lesser realms for a chance at redemption.“And I was sent to one of the worst; Earth.”“How do you get back?”“I need to conquer not through destruction, but manipulation. It goes against my nature, but it is the way of life in the infernal realm where all strength is equal. To prove my worth, I need to work with humans and other lesser creatures.”“Then why are you destroying my city?”She sighs and furrows her eyebrows.“Because I’m pissed off, ok?”You continue talking to the demon, who tells you her name is Aria, until you come to a complete understanding of each other’s motivations. Still, after everything you’ve learned about each other she says,“I’m still going to destroy your city. Although there may be one thing you could do to stop me…”She explains how a nearby wizard has imprisoned her friend, Azor, and offers to spare your city in exchange for his freedom.“You have 24 hours, or your city goes up in flames.”Your blood boils over the fact she still desires to destroy the city. Your morality prevents you from standing aside and letting your city burn. You have your sword in hand and amour equipped. Why not pretend to agree then attack when she least expects it?\n",

      "How could you possibly save your city and survive? As much as you don’t want to admit it, you can’t win without some help. You sprint to the drunk tortoise tavern (which luckily is on the opposite side of the city that is being terrorized) and bust through the door. It’s completely empty aside from a single person.“Long time no see bud.”It’s Greg, he has bright red cheeks and is swaying slightly.“Why are you still here? There’s a demon on a murder rampage outside!”He chuckles then says,“Sometimes you don’t want to be saved. I’m staying here and if I die, so be it.”“Well let me join you,” you say with no intention of sitting around to die.You and Greg sit together and talk about all sorts of things while drinking. This isn’t like the before, when the conversation revolved around meaningless hypotheticals. You delve into some deep shit in a relatively short amount of time. You talk about politics, the meaning of life, and what happens after you die. While this is all going on, the demon continues massacring your entire city. Oops, looks like getting drunk has made you forget your priorities. When the realization dawns on you after a few drinks, you waste no time in shouting,“Catia!”Greg squints at you, clearly remembering the name from the last time you talked. This look of curiosity turns into horror as a swirling red cloud appears in front of you. Catia stands before you but looks much different than before. Unlike her human-like form, she has dark red skin and humongous bat wings.“You call me once again, how pathetic are you?”This question strikes you with surprise as it’s the first time she has shown open hostility towards you. Greg on the other hand begins laughing, then says,“Is this the demon that’s been destroying the city? Man, I thought it would be at least a little bigger than that. I know it's rich coming from me, but damn how can something as small as that destroy the city?”“Shut up already Greg! This isn’t the demon that’s been attacking the city.”Greg looks at you in confusion as Catia speaks up,“He's right you know, I haven’t killed a single person in weeks. That is, until now.”Catia takes to the air and flies towards Greg. His drunken state makes him slow to react as Catia rips his throat out. Blood sprays everywhere like a broken faucet.“Who’s the small one now, bitch?”“Jeez I know he was asking for it, but you didn’t have to kill him.”Catia turns her head towards you and shows no remorse. Her pupils have shrunk, giving her eyes a milk white appearance.“This is all your fault, why couldn’t you have just listened to Aria?”She advances towards you, snarling like a wild beast.“Wait just a second I didn’t have a chance—“And you didn’t have a chance to finish that sentence either as Catia pulls your throat off your body like a soldier grabs a sword off a rack. You die in a puddle of mixed, throat extracted, blood.\n",

      "You can barely move, so you know you’re in a susceptible state. The question is, does she still want to see you?“Catia,” you whisper.You wait a few tense seconds and feel the pain in your head begin to relieve itself. But then, nothing. She never comes and the pain comes rushing back. You find tears streaming down your face as you realize your chances with Catia are probably over. You’re also in no state to continue working as a guard and will probably be fired soon. The only thing you can do is lay in bed and suffer.Days past and your state of mind only gets worse. You begin seeing shadowy figures at the corner of your eyes. One day you manage to touch one and ask,“Who are you?”He laughs and laughs before disappearing. This isn’t the most psychologically scaring part of this ordeal. Your recurring nightmares are much worse. You dream of your family returning home in vivid detail, only for it to all come crashing down as you realize they're not real. You stop eating and drink only when necessary. It gets to a point where you know if you don’t try to seek help you will die.You have no idea where to go for help, especially since the local witch doctor has been arrested for using humans as potion ingredients. You wander aimlessly taking morning walks in a vain attempt to find your savior. Shadowy figures whisper about you as you walk past.“There’s nothing out here, return home”“You’re never going to get better, why not end it?”You’ve been seeing these shadowy figures more frequently recently. You chalk this up to your lack of sleep. Sleeping is when your most vulnerable, so you try to do as little of it as you can.During a morning walk you run into a familiar face. It’s your childhood friend Julia. You haven’t seen her since schooling and boy does she look different.“Is that…” she says“Yeah it’s me,” you reply“Boy do you look different.”You haven’t been grooming yourself since the madness occurred. You have lots of dark circles under your eyes and probably don’t smell too good either.“You also look different.”She raises an eyebrow not knowing if your complementing or insulting her.“In a good way in a good way!” you clarify.She laughs as her dress flows in the wind.“Sorry I can’t say the same to you. Down on your luck?”“That’s putting it lightly,” you say jokingly, even though it’s the truth.“Hahah I bet. I was just about to get some coffee, wanna come with?”“Would I ever! Is it ok if the shadow people follow along?”“The what?”“Never mind.”LaterJulia and you decided to go to the Cinnamon Pearl Cafe. As fancy as it may seem, its nothing more than a place to eat pastries and drink coffee. She begins telling you what’s she’s been doing lately.“You know Andy right?”“Of course, me and him have been on guard duty together a couple times.”Julia bites her lips and chooses her words carefully,“Well we broke up recently due to the fact that he...he...raped me...”You’re shocked at this revelation, Andy has always seemed like a standup guy.“How could he do such a thing?”“He’s a piece of shit that’s how!”Your lower your head as she composes herself.“Sorry, I’m just not in the best mental space right now.”“No need to apologize, you have every right to be angry.”“Thank you.”“So tell me, what happened?”She explains how one night, after a long tiring day working as a cleaner, Andy wanted sex. They had been dating for a few months and had yet to have sex. The conversation went a little like this,“All of my other friends constantly brag about sex. If I keep telling them I haven’t fucked you yet they might start thinking I’m gay,\" says Andy.“Stop pressuring me! I told you, I am not in the mood and am not ready to pursue that kind of relationship with you.”“You’re such a bitch, you know that right? Fuck you make me angry,” Andy says while walking towards Julia menacingly.“Back off, get away from me!”Julia stops talking and begins to choke up. She covers her face with her hands and says shakily,“He grabbed me and wouldn’t let go. I tried to scream but he covered my mouth and clenched my throat. He violated me and nobody cares to do anything about it. Everyone’s to focused on the damn demons to give a shit about poor ol’ me.”“That’s horrible, who else have you told?”“Just you and the captain of the fucking guards. He wouldn’t even fire him, saying the demand for guards is ‘very high’ right now. No guard is better than a guards that’s a mother fucking rapist.”“I wish I could help, but the captain probably won’t listen to me anymore. I haven’t shown up for work in days and didn’t give any notice.”“It’s ok, I don’t want the captain’s help anyways. I need to move on and be strong.”You make small talk about various things before saying your goodbyes. With Julia in such a vulnerable state, you wonder if it’s best to give her time to heal. At the same time, you long for human relationship. The shadow figures just aren’t the same as real human contact.\n",

      "Your brain aches with pain and going to what you assume is the source of the pain will probably make it worst. While you’ve never been too trusting of witches, you know a local one with good reputation. As you make your way outside the light pierces through your skull. Your eye sockets feel like their burning and your brain feels like it’s melting. You press on and begin to enter the slums of the city. The practice of brewing potions containing humans, a required ingredient for witch doctors, is not exactly legal. Still, you are in no place to have such prejudice considering if your head keeps pounding like it is now, you might just kill someone.You reach the witch doctor’s office and make your way inside. It’s pretty busy at the moment, which is no surprise as people want protection from demons. You wait in a line of about twenty people. The pounding has intensified, and you aren’t even aware how much time has passed when somebody says,“Excuse me, do you need to see the witch doctor”“SHUT UP!” you snap.The clerk cowers as you finish screaming at him. You manage to calm down and whisper,“Please help me.”The clerk nods and orders you to follow him. You go down a hall way affixed with a assortment of trinkets and baubles pinned to the walls.“To keep away evil spirts,” the clerk explains.There is a huge variety of objects that you would normally want to know more about. You are in no mood now though and continue down the hall until you reach the doctor.You enter a room lit only by bright red stones. In the center lays a boiling pot emitting the scent of rotten egg. The bright lights distract you from even noticing the witch doctor standing right in front of you.“I sense a demonic curse within you. Don’t worry, I know the perfect potion for you.”The witch doctor, who prefers you call her “a potion brewer”, starts throwing a concoction of ingredients into a cauldron.“One imp carcass to ward off spirts, 2 cups of orc blood for personal strength, and a dash of lemon juice.”“Why lemon?’ you ask.She smiles and says,“For flavor silly! Do you think you could stomach a potion solely comprised of raw meat and blood?”She mixes everything together and pours out the cauldron into multiple bottles. She hands you one and the smell alone relieves your head. You down the vial and struggle to hold back from vomiting. It’s a lot thicker than you thought and the blood clumps up in your throat. The potion brewer notices your discomfort and gives you a small vial composed of a black liquid.“Drink this it will help.”You do as told and gulp the vial down. It seems to do the trick as the clumped blood slides down your throat. You still want to vomit out your insides.“So how will you be paying today, soul or servitude?”“I thought you accepted coin.”“Oh, we do, but the black vial I gave you was extremely valuable. The ingredients needed to make it cannot be paid by mere coin.”“What! How expensive can it be to make a potion that clears your throat?”She laughs and shakes her head before saying,“That’s not what the potion did, silly! It’s what I give to people if I sense they are close to death. It will prevent any proximate death, but can only be used once.”“Why not just give me something else then?”“I wasn’t sure if the curse was attacking you or if you were having an allergic reaction to the potion. While I can sense a lot, I’m not psychic. Rather than make a guess I did the only thing I could to guarantee your life.”“I suppose that makes sense.”“Great! Now how about that payment, soul or servitude?”\n",

      "You continue lying around and try to fall asleep. The pain won’t let this happen and you lie in bed starring at the ceiling. You start thinking about Catia again as it seems to be the only thing you can focus on. You think about how much of an idiot you are for passing up sex with a demon.Your front door makes a loud squeaking sounds followed by footsteps. Is Catia back to finish the job? You try to get to grab your sword but your head pounds forcing you to stay in bed. Expecting Catia to kill you at any second, you are very surprised to hear,“Son, I’m home.”“Mmmm—-mmmmm—-mmother?“Yes, it’s me and I come baring bad news. Your Father, he was killed on our way home. I feel so empty I don’t know how I’ll go on.”She begins crying into her hands. The pounding in your head stops, allowing you to get up to comfort her.“Everything will ok you just have to stay strong,” you say while patting her back.Your mother looks up at you and smiles. Her blue eyes shine through the tears and you know everything will be ok. She goes in to hug you and you return the favor. As you embrace, she massages your back making you feel like a kid again. She whispers into your ear,“Will you sleep with me tonight? I don’t want to be alone after all that’s happened.”Now you’re really starting to feel like a kid again. This is your mother and as sad as it sounds, you could also use some company after all that’s happened.“Sure, I don’t want to be alone either.”You both fall into bed and feel instant relief. She moves closer to you and grabs your hand. She moves your arm over her body and huddles your body close to your chest. As much as you want to say something about how uncomfortable this makes you feel, you know she needs company after all she’s been through. You no longer feel like a kid, but feel like your father? This is pretty weird, but its just one night. One weird night is nothing to be alarmed about.You drift off to sleep and have the best night of rest you’ve had in years. When you wake up you're surprised to find your mother still pressed up against your chest. Not wanting to disturb her, you just lay there eyes open. Your headache is gone, and you think you know why. Only the love between a son and a mother could dispel the curse Catia put on you. Your mother soon wakes up and says,“I don’t want to be too forward, but can we do this again tonight? The horrors I saw, the bloodshed, is too much for me to be left alone with my thoughts. I need someone to be my rock, so I don’t fall into the pit of despair.”You’ve never seen your mother so sad before, thought its understandable. The question is, are you ok with doing this again? Sure, one night of sleeping in the same bed of your mom after such trauma isn’t that crazy. But doing again, that may be a bit crazy.\n",

      "“I may know of a potential replacement.”“No need not to not speak in absolutes. Spit it out sonny.”You stumbled a bit, not because your scared to tell him, but because his syntax confuses you.“Erm… I—I… his name is Eric.”“Who is this so-called Eric?”“He was the man I was sitting with. He’s looking for work and seems like a good fellow.”“That’s all I need, tell him he’s hired. Oh, and he starts immediately. 11pm tonight tell him to go to the city walls.”“Tonight? Isn’t this all happening a bit too fast?”“Nonsense, plus he won’t be doing it alone. He’ll have you to teach him.”You tense up as Dario continues,“Lighten up, kid! I took the initiative and brought fur coats for each of you.”Hell of an initiative considering you almost died two nights ago.“Thanks for taking the initiative…”“You’re most certainly welcomed! Now that that’s settled, get the hell out of here!”You stand up and leave his office. Eric does a one tooth smile as you walk over to him.“What was that all about?”You have a sly smile on your face when you say,“It was about you, congrats you’re now a guard!”He gives you a look of confusion and asks,“What the hell are you talking about?”You explain how guards are in high demand and that you mentioned him to the captain. “And I almost forgot, you start tonight.”“Wait what?”“Don’t worry, I’m on guard duty tonight as well. Plus, I’ve only ever seen demons one time...”“That one time was last night!”“Actually two nights ago, but never mind that. Anyways the captain brought fur coats for the both of us so no freezing to death tonight. C’mon, let’s get rolling.”“Alright but don’t act like this is permanent, if I don’t like it, I’m quitting after tonight.”“Trust me, it’ll be much easier now that we won’t be freezing. I have a feeling you’ll stick around.” \n",

      "“Lars might not be the best guard, but he’s the best option available. On the bright side, we at least seem to get along.”Dario’s face turns dark red as he spits out,“If he’s the best option, then this city might burn in flames tonight. None of us are safe with him on duty.”“So I take it that you won’t be rehiring him?”The captains sighs deeply out of frustration.“Look, tell him he can guard tonight. However, if he messes up one more time, he’s out for good.”You do a small fist bump out of celebration.“Not so fast sonny, you’re going with him.”“Really? Even after what happened the last time we were on guard duty together?”“You said it yourself, you two get along. Now, get out and get to work.”You leave in a pissed off mood, however the captain adds one thing before you slam his door shut.“I brought fur coats for the both of you. They’re in your lockers and it’s best if you wear them tonight.”You leave in a slightly less pissed off mood and slam the door. Eric does a one tooth smile as you walk over to him.“What was that all about?”“Nothing too important. I have to go now, it was nice meeting you.”Nice meeting you too...”You leave and head over to Lars house. It’s best to tell him the good news as soon as you can. You get there shortly and he answers the door right away.“So did you do it? Did you tell the captain what really happened.”“I convinced the captain to give you your job back, that’s all that matters.”Lars looks like he wants to argue, but holds back.“I’m just happy my family won’t starve to death. Oh, and that I won’t have to kill you,” he says with a wink.“Yeah it’s great news, now follow me. The captain brought fur coats for both of us.” \n",

      "You’re both facing adversity in life. In a sense, you’ve both been raped. Julia in a literal sense and yourself in a mental sense. Catia cursed you and has left you a shell of your former self.The past few days have been hell. Why not reconnect with a old friend and see if it leads anywhere? Everyday you walk to the Cinnamon Pearl Cafe hoping to see Julia. A few days go by and you never see her, however it’s not all bad. You’re now eating and staying hydrated, which is never a bad thing. You haven’t seen any shadow people in days and have stopped having nightmares. Things are looking up for you.One day after ordering your usual (a cup of coffee and cinnamon toast) Julia walks in. She’s all alone and you make eye contact with her. She winks at you and holds up a finger indicating that you should give her a second. You watch as she orders a coffee and raisin bread. After paying, she walks over to join you.“I’m surprised to see you here,” she says.“I’m here all the time now. I mean, their coffee’s really great.”She laughs and asks,“How have you been doing?”“I’m great, but I’ve been worrying about you, how have you been holding up?”She gets a little teary eyed while saying,“That’s so sweet of you, but you don’t have to worry about me. I’m planning on leaving Ashton tomorrow morning.”You sit mouth agape shocked at the news. She could have easy left without telling you. You might have gone mad waiting for her, but now you have a chance to leave with her.“Why are you leaving? I get why you might not want to live in a place with bad memories of your past, but why leave so soon?”“It’s no longer safe here and you should know better than anyone being a guard and all.”“Former guard, and what do you mean it’s not safe? I haven’t heard of any demon sightings...”“Well there was one just a few nights ago and people living in Ashton died. I have family up in Kingsburg and know I’ll be safe there.”“Are you going all alone or bringing anyone with you?”“As of now, all alone. I don’t know how difficult travel will be, back if I survive, I’ll finally have a place to call home.”You really don’t think it’s a good idea for her to travel alone. One for the selfish reason of wanting to be close to her, but also because it’s the middle of winter and travel hasn’t been safe since the demonic invasion. This is all happening so fast, you barely know Julia the adult considering you just reconnect with you. Will she even let you come with her if you ask? \n",

      "You agree to comfort her again tonight. It’s as weird as the last time, but it seems to make your mom happy and that’s all a son could want.“Thank you, I need this right now,” she says as you massage her back.You sleep in the same bed as your mom everyday for the next few weeks. Demon sighting have been occurring more frequently and your mother is becoming increasingly worried.“I think we need to get out of Ashton before its too late,” she says.“Where will we go and how could we survive alone?”“I know a place, but you have to trust me.”You have no reason not to trust her and follow her once nightfall arrives. You leave the city walls and venture into a nearby forest.“Where exactly are we going?”“You’ll see.”She speeds up showing a surprising amount of fitness for a middle-aged woman. You eventually reach a clearing where a river flows against rocks.“It’s beautiful,” you say stunned..“Not as beautiful as you,” your mother says with a playful wink.It gets kind of awkward for a bit until you break the silence.“I still don’t understand what we’re doing here. How is a forest any safe than Ashton?”“Oh, it’s not safer at all. I just wanted to go somewhere nobody could hear you scream,”Your mother dashes at you with inhuman speed. She pins you down and starts ripping off your clothes“Ever since father died, I’ve had to suppress my sexual desires. Not anymore, never again.”You try to struggle but it's no use. You find yourself buck naked in the middle of forest.“I want you to enjoy this as much as I do, so please don’t fight back.”You always assumed you were stronger than mother but aren’t so sure now. Perhaps you should give in to a deep seeded desire you’ve repressed for all these years.\n",
